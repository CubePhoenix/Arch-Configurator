# Arch-Configurator

This is a script used for configuring Arch-Based distributions (pacman is required)
It is mostly written for myself and thus not very user-friendly or error-tolerating.

To install, clone the repository into any directory and type:

```bash
./install.sh
```

If that doesn't work, use
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```
first to make the .sh file executable.

My configuration is built ontop of i3-gaps. (The keyboard shortcuts are mostly the original
ones)
